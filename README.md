LLAMA2 is a LLM model which was released by meta.Llama 2 is a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters.This is the collab file for the 7B pretrained model.

Model Architecture Llama 2 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align to human preferences for helpfulness and safety.

Intended Use Cases Llama 2 is intended for commercial and research use in English. Tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.

This collab is created to show the basic implementation of LLAMA2 model on a intented pdf to have Q/A interaction. The model will interact with the pdf and it will either retrieve or generate a answer depending on the findings it finds in the pdf.
